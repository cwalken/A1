<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dean Fabris<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc325299</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>CossiePlay has been operating for four years and are trying to improve their business by branching out with a focus on online presence.<br> 
The websites main goal is to allow customers(preferably the target audience) to book a spot online which will increase attendance to the monthly parties held by CossiePlay.<br>
Its secondary goal is to sell cosplay items similar to an online store.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To measure the main goal of the website you would have to correlate the data of 'tickets' sold from before the website was implemented to after implementation. From a technical standpoint the evaluation would possibly<br> 
generate in failure as the devices used by the Target Demographic generally don't work well with 'fixed' webpages.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for this website is High School Kids to Young Adults, unfortunately the website I have generated does not scale well on Smartphones and Tablets. This may cause issues as this<br>
  is the type of devices that the intended audience usually have access to.</p>
