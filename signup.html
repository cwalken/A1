	  <h2>Sign-Up</h2>
       <p>On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free*. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).

      <h2>Party Guidelines</h2>
       <p>*Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge.  Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons** will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the party-goer.</p>
       <p>**CossiePlay party-goers party at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety. Check with your doctor before you party hard.</p>
